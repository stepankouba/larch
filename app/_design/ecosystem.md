# The ecosystem ideas

There should be one place, where dashboards (DBs) and Widgets (W) are shared. Private and public modules are available.

Public are treated as available for everyone.

Private can be used only to those registered users and teams, that are specified within the management console.

Three objects may be shared:
- Dashboard
	- collection of widget templates or widgets
- Widget template
	- JS, HTML, CSS, ...
	- something like larch CLI
- Widget
	- may be shared with predefined settings
	- the same as above + settings
